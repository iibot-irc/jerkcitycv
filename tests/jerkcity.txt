JERKCITY #728: untitled gardening project no. 1 
9/20/2000

: I masturbate just about daily. Sometimes twice if something sets me off. Like an Entertainment Tonight segment on supermodels or the mailman. You have to be willing to go down that path and find your inner masturbator and convince him to get into the zone and go for the gold. If not the gold then perhaps a handful of semen.

JERKCITY #729: untitled gardening project no. 2 
9/21/2000

: Sometimes, when I go on business trips or vacations, I don't get a chance to masturbate.  When you stomp around a strange city all day and come back to an impersonal hotel room, it's hard to get it on.  Here's a tip: pack something soft to spurt into.  Leave it in the room after you check out.

Thank goodness he let me off with a warning.

: For the most part, you can determine how many times you have masturbated. Pick a year the battle began and an average number of sessions per day. Consider this: when all the numbers are multiplied out, you can then determine how much semen you've generated. Enough to drown a toddler? Hmm?

JERKCITY #1534: pot brownie recipe 
12/11/2002

</tt><h3>ozone's pot brownie recipe</h3><tt>
1/3 c flour 1/4 teasp baking powder 3 tablesp shortening (butter works fine) 3/4 c sugar (brown works great) dash salt 2 tablesp corn syrup 1 beaten egg 1 square baking chocolate 1 tablesp vanilla 3/4 c chopped nuts (optional) a coffee grinder half full, finely ground<p>
the corn syrup seems to be the key to the whole thing. there's no need to clean the active ingredient, just stuff it in there whole. make a pot of coffee afterwards without cleaning the grinder.<p>
mix shortening, sugar, corn syrup, egg, sift in flour, baking powder, salt, stir in chocolate and everything else. put greased 8" pan (glass is best). bake 20 minutes at 350f let cool. cut into 8 pieces. test carefully.
